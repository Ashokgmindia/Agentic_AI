The user wants me to create a High-Level Project Vision Document for a "Personal Finance Tracker App". I need to structure the document according to the provided template and populate it with information derived from the user's input. The input provides a project description and a list of key features. I will use this information to fill in the relevant sections of the vision document.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each section:

1.  **Vision Statement**: I'll craft an inspiring statement based on the project description.
2.  **Business Goals & Strategic Alignment**: I'll infer general financial management goals. Since no specific organizational strategy is provided, I'll state that alignment needs further definition.
3.  **Scope**: I'll define in-scope features based on the input and infer potential out-of-scope areas for clarity. Assumptions and constraints will be general for now.
4.  **Stakeholders**: I'll identify common stakeholder groups for such an application (Users, Product Owners, Development Team, etc.) and their general expectations.
5.  **High-Level Features & Functionalities**: I'll list the provided key features and then detail specific functionalities within each, expanding on what "tracking income/expenses" and "budgeting" might entail.
6.  **Risks & Dependencies**: I'll identify general strategic risks for a new app and potential dependencies.
7.  **Success Metrics**: I'll suggest common metrics for a financial app.
8.  **High-Level Roadmap**: I'll propose a phased approach (MVP, future enhancements).
9.  **Open Questions**: I'll identify areas where more information is needed to refine the document.
10. **Document Metadata**: I'll add the specified metadata.

I don't need any tools for this task as all the information is provided as text. I can directly generate the Markdown document.
