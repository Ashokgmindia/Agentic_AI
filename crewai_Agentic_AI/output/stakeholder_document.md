## 4. Conflicting Requirements & Resolutions
-   **Identified Conflicts**: Based on the limited input provided, no specific conflicting requirements have been identified at this stage.
-   **Root Cause**: N/A
-   **Recommended Resolution**: This section will be populated following detailed stakeholder consultations and requirement refinement workshops. Potential conflicts often arise between user experience desires (e.g., ease of use, flexibility) and security/compliance mandates (e.g., strict access controls, data masking), or between desired functionality and budget constraints.

## 5. Risks & Mitigation Strategies
-   **Technical Risks**:
    *   **Risk**: Data migration complexity and potential data loss/corruption.
        *   **Likelihood**: Medium; **Impact**: High
        *   **Mitigation**: Develop a detailed data migration plan, conduct pilot migrations, implement data validation checks, and ensure robust backup procedures.
    *   **Risk**: Integration challenges with existing enterprise systems (e.g., CRM, DAM, ERP).
        *   **Likelihood**: Medium; **Impact**: Medium
        *   **Mitigation**: Define clear integration APIs and protocols early; conduct thorough integration testing; engage system owners of integrated platforms.
    *   **Risk**: Performance degradation under load.
        *   **Likelihood**: Medium; **Impact**: High
        *   **Mitigation**: Implement performance testing throughout the development lifecycle; optimize database queries and code; consider caching strategies.
-   **Operational Risks**:
    *   **Risk**: Low user adoption due to complex interface or inadequate training.
        *   **Likelihood**: Medium; **Impact**: High
        *   **Mitigation**: Prioritize user-centric design (UX/UI); conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with representative users; provide comprehensive training materials and support.
    *   **Risk**: Inadequate ongoing maintenance and support resources.
        *   **Likelihood**: Low; **Impact**: Medium
        *   **Mitigation**: Secure dedicated operational resources and budget; establish clear support SLAs; plan for regular system updates and patches.

    *   **Risk**: Non-compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) regarding user data or content handling.
        *   **Likelihood**: Medium; **Impact**: High
        *   **Mitigation**: Implement role-based access controls, data masking where necessary, consent management features, and ensure audit trails capture relevant data processing activities. Engage Legal/Compliance early.
    *   **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.
        *   **Likelihood**: Medium; **Impact**: High
        *   **Mitigation**: Follow secure coding practices, conduct regular security assessments (penetration testing, vulnerability scans), implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
-   **Timeline Risks**:
    *   **Risk**: Scope creep extending project timelines and budget.
        *   **Likelihood**: High; **Impact**: Medium
        *   **Mitigation**: Implement a strict change control process; clearly define MVP (Minimum Viable Product) scope; prioritize requirements rigorously.

## 6. Compliance & Governance Considerations
-   **Applicable Regulations**:
    *   **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Requirements for handling personal data, consent management, data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure), and data breach notification.
    *   **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) / California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)**: Similar to GDPR, focusing on consumer rights regarding personal information.
    *   **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**: Standards for making web content accessible to people with disabilities (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA).
    *   **Industry-Specific Regulations**: Depending on the organization's sector (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare, SOX for financial services), additional compliance requirements may apply to content handling and data security.
-   **Data Privacy, Security, and Audit Implications**:
    *   **Data Privacy**: The CMS must be designed with privacy-by-design principles. This includes clear policies on data collection, usage, storage, and deletion. Mechanisms for managing user consent and fulfilling data subject requests are critical.
    *   **Security**: Robust authentication, authorization, encryption (in transit and at rest), protection against common web attacks, and regular security patching are essential.
    *   **Audit Trails**: The system must maintain comprehensive audit logs detailing content creation, modification, publishing, deletion, and access events to ensure accountability and support compliance audits.
-   **Required Controls or Documentation**:
    *   Privacy Policy and Terms of Service updates.
    *   Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with vendors if applicable.
    *   Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs).
    *   Security assessment reports.
    *   User access and permission matrices.

    *   A standard set of user roles (e.g., Administrator, Editor, Contributor, Viewer) will be required.
    *   The CMS will need to integrate with at least one existing system (e.g., DAM, Analytics).
    *   The organization adheres to standard data privacy and security best practices.
-   **Open Questions**:
    *   What specific types of content will the CMS primarily manage (e.g., web pages, blog posts, articles, documents, multimedia)?
    *   What are the key business units or departments that will be the primary users of the CMS?
    *   What is the expected volume of content to be managed initially and over the next 3-5 years?
    *   Are there specific content workflows or approval processes that need to be replicated or improved?
    *   What are the critical integrations required with existing systems (e.g., CRM, Marketing Automation, ERP, DAM, Analytics)?
    *   What are the specific security policies, data retention policies, and compliance mandates the CMS must adhere to beyond general regulations?
    *   What is the preferred deployment model (e.g., Cloud/SaaS, On-Premise, Hybrid)?
    *   What is the estimated budget for the CMS implementation and ongoing maintenance?
    *   Are there specific performance benchmarks or Service Level Agreements (SLAs) required?
