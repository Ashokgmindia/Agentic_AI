### Identified Potential Risks or Blockers

*   **Risk:** Unclear password strength requirements for registration could lead to rework.
    *   **Mitigation:** Confirm password complexity rules (e.g., minimum length, character types) with the Product Owner before implementation.
*   **Risk:** External dependency on a yet-to-be-chosen database technology might cause integration delays.
    *   **Mitigation:** Finalize database selection by [Date - e.g., tomorrow] to allow for environment setup and early integration testing.
*   **Risk:** Team members may have varying levels of familiarity with the chosen frontend framework, potentially impacting estimation accuracy and development speed.
    *   **Mitigation:** Schedule a brief knowledge-sharing session on the framework at the start of the sprint. Pair programming can also help distribute knowledge.
*   **Risk:** Ambiguity in "basic contact details" could lead to scope creep for the "Add Contact" feature.
    *   **Mitigation:** Clearly define and document the exact fields considered "basic" for the "Add Contact" story during sprint planning refinement.
