    *   AC3.4: Extracted information can be directly saved as a new contact in the user's device or a designated contact list within the app.
    *   AC3.5: The image of the business card is also saved.

**FR4: Document Scan**
*   **Description:** The system shall allow users to scan general documents (e.g., invoices, receipts, reports, notes). The system should optimize image capture for clarity and legibility.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   AC4.1: User can initiate a general document scan.
    *   AC4.2: The application provides tools for cropping, rotating, and adjusting image brightness/contrast.
    *   AC4.3: The system supports scanning multi-page documents.
    *   AC4.4: Scanned documents can be saved in a common format (e.g., PDF, JPG).

### 3.2 User Features

**FR5: Create Account**
*   **Description:** The system shall allow new users to create a personal account to store and manage their scanned documents.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   AC5.1: User can access an account creation screen.
    *   AC5.2: Required fields include username, email, and password.
    *   AC5.3: Email verification process is in place.
    *   AC5.4: User receives confirmation upon successful account creation.

**FR6: Add Documents to Favorites**
*   **Description:** The system shall allow users to mark specific scanned documents as 'favorites' for quick access.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   AC6.1: User can select one or more documents.
    *   AC6.2: A 'favorite' option is available for selected documents.
    *   AC6.3: Favorited documents are displayed in a dedicated 'Favorites' section or marked visually.
    *   AC6.4: User can remove a document from favorites.

**FR7: Sort Documents**
*   **Description:** The system shall allow users to sort their scanned documents based on various criteria.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   AC7.1: Users can sort documents by date created (ascending/descending).
    *   AC7.2: Users can sort documents by document name (alphabetical A-Z, Z-A).
    *   AC7.3: Users can sort documents by document type (if applicable/tagged).
    *   AC7.4: The sorting is applied consistently across the document list.

**FR8: Edit Documents**
*   **Description:** The system shall allow users to perform basic edits on their scanned documents.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**

    *   AC9.3: Deleted documents are permanently removed from the system.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1: Performance:** Scanning and processing operations should be performed in a timely manner, ideally within seconds for single-page scans. Document list loading and sorting should be responsive, even with a large number of documents.
*   **NFR2: Usability:** The application interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for users of all technical skill levels. On-screen prompts and guidance should be clear and helpful.
*   **NFR3: Security:** User account information and scanned documents must be stored securely. Data transmission should be encrypted.
*   **NFR4: Compatibility:** The application should be compatible with common mobile operating systems (e.g., iOS, Android) and device hardware (cameras).
*   **NFR5: Reliability:** The application should be stable and not prone to crashing during scanning or document management operations.
*   **NFR6: Data Integrity:** Scanned document data should be preserved without corruption during storage and retrieval. OCR accuracy should be maintained.

## 5. Dependencies

*   **D1: Device Camera Access:** The application requires access to the device's camera hardware.
*   **D2: Storage Permissions:** The application requires permission to store scanned documents on the device or in cloud storage.
*   **D3: Network Connectivity (for account creation/sync):** Internet connectivity is required for user account creation, verification, and potential cloud synchronization of documents.

## 6. Gaps and Considerations

*   **G1: OCR Specificity:** The requirements do not detail the extent of OCR for IDs and Books (e.g., full text extraction vs. metadata). Clarification is needed.
*   **G2: Document Naming:** A standard naming convention for scanned documents or a mechanism for user-defined naming is not specified.
*   **G3: Cloud Storage/Sync:** The current requirements do not include cloud storage or synchronization capabilities, which could be a valuable future enhancement for backups and cross-device access.
*   **G4: Advanced Organization:** Beyond 'favorites' and 'sorting', features like folders or tagging for document organization are not defined.
*   **G5: Sharing Functionality:** The ability for users to share their scanned documents with others is not included in the initial scope.
*   **G6: Offline Capabilities:** The extent of offline functionality for document management (editing, favoriting, etc.) needs further definition.
