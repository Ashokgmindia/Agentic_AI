**Business Requirements Document (BRD) - Insurance System**

**1. Introduction**
This document outlines the business requirements for a new insurance system. The system aims to streamline policy management, claims processing, and customer interactions while ensuring compliance with insurance industry regulations.

**2. Business Objectives**

        *   The system validates data upon entry to ensure accuracy and completeness.
        *   The system generates a unique policy number upon successful creation.
        *   The system can save a draft policy if not completed immediately.

**Module: Claims Processing**

*   **User Story 4:** As a Policyholder, I want to submit a new claim online so that I can initiate the claims process conveniently.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**

        *   The system displays comprehensive customer information, including contact details, policy summaries, and claim history.
        *   CSRs can update customer contact information.

**4. Non-Functional Requirements**
*   **Performance:** The system must be able to handle 100 concurrent users for policy management and 50 concurrent users for claims processing with response times under 3 seconds for critical operations.
*   **Security:** All sensitive customer and financial data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest. Role-based access control must be implemented to restrict user permissions. The system must comply with industry-standard security protocols.
*   **Availability:** The system should have an uptime of 99.9% excluding scheduled maintenance.
*   **Scalability:** The system architecture should support a 20% annual growth in policyholders and transaction volume for the next five years.
*   **Usability:** The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for all user roles (Agents, Policyholders, Adjusters, Underwriters).
*   **Compliance:** The system must comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA if applicable) and insurance-specific regulations (e.g., state insurance department requirements). Audit trails for all data modifications must be maintained.

**5. Dependencies and Gaps**

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   **Integration with Financial System:** For processing claim payments.
    *   **Identity Verification Service:** For customer onboarding and authentication.

    *   **Marketing and Communication Module:** Functionality for automated customer outreach or marketing campaigns is not included.
    *   **Third-Party Integrations:** Specific integrations beyond the core financial system (e.g., external fraud detection services) are not detailed.
    *   **Specific Underwriting Rules Engine:** While underwriting review is mentioned, the complexity of underwriting rules might require a separate, more detailed specification.
    *   **User Training Materials:** Development of training documentation and programs for different user roles is a necessary follow-up activity.
