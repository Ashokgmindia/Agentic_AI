I understand the task. I need to create a 3-6 month product roadmap for a public transport delegation project. This roadmap should outline major milestones, prioritize features, set clear timelines, and define measurable success criteria. I will leverage the provided inputs and ensure the output aligns with business goals and customer needs, presented in the specified format.

**Product Vision:** To empower public transport commuters with greater control and flexibility through intelligent delegation of their travel plans, reducing stress and optimizing their daily commutes.

**Product Strategy:** We will focus on building a user-friendly platform that allows users to delegate aspects of their public transport journey, starting with real-time travel updates and extending to automated re-routing based on predefined preferences. Our initial rollout will prioritize core delegation functionalities and essential integrations, iterating based on user feedback and market adoption.

#### **Month 1-2: Core Delegation & Real-time Updates**

*   **Major Milestones:**
    *   **Milestone 1.1: User Profile & Delegation Preferences Setup**
        *   **Priority:** High
        *   **Description:** Users can create profiles and define basic delegation preferences (e.g., preferred modes of transport, acceptable detour times, contact person for delegation).
        *   **Timeline:** End of Month 1
        *   **Success Metrics:**
            *   50% of active users complete profile setup.
            *   Average time to complete profile setup < 3 minutes.
            *   User satisfaction score for profile setup > 4.0/5.0.
    *   **Milestone 1.2: Real-time Trip Delegation & Notification System**
        *   **Priority:** High
        *   **Description:** Users can delegate their current or upcoming public transport trip to a designated contact. The system will send real-time updates to both the delegator and the delegatee.
        *   **Timeline:** End of Month 2
        *   **Success Metrics:**
            *   15% of active users utilize the trip delegation feature at least once.
            *   Average of 2 trip delegations per active user within the first month of release.
            *   Notification delivery success rate > 99%.
            *   User satisfaction with notification clarity and timeliness > 4.2/5.0.

*   **Reasoning for Prioritization:**
    *   **User Profile Setup (High):** This is foundational for any personalization and delegation features. Without it, users cannot configure who they delegate to or their preferences.
    *   **Real-time Trip Delegation (High):** This is the core value proposition of the product. It directly addresses the customer need for managing unexpected journey changes and provides immediate utility. The real-time aspect is crucial for public transport where timeliness is key.

#### **Month 3-4: Intelligent Re-routing & Scenario Management**

*   **Major Milestones:**
    *   **Milestone 2.1: Automated Re-routing based on Predefined Rules**
        *   **Priority:** High
        *   **Description:** The system automatically suggests or applies re-routing options based on user-defined rules (e.g., "if my usual bus is delayed by more than 10 minutes, reroute me via the metro") and notifies the delegatee.
        *   **Timeline:** End of Month 3
        *   **Success Metrics:**
            *   20% of users enable automated re-routing.
            *   Average of 3 re-routing events managed per user who has enabled the feature.
            *   User satisfaction with re-routing accuracy and relevance > 4.1/5.0.
            *   Reduction in reported missed connections by users utilizing re-routing by 10%.
    *   **Milestone 2.2: Multiple Delegatee Options & Permissions**
        *   **Priority:** Medium
        *   **Description:** Users can assign different delegatees to different types of trips or scenarios, with customizable permission levels (e.g., view only, receive alerts, make minor adjustments).
        *   **Timeline:** End of Month 4
        *   **Success Metrics:**
            *   10% of users assign multiple delegatees.
            *   Average of 1.5 delegatees assigned per user.
            *   User feedback on flexibility of delegatee assignment > 75% positive.

*   **Reasoning for Prioritization:**
    *   **Automated Re-routing (High):** This significantly enhances the delegation value by proactively handling common disruptions, further reducing user stress and improving journey reliability.
    *   **Multiple Delegatee Options (Medium):** While valuable for flexibility, it's a secondary enhancement to the core delegation and re-routing. It caters to more complex user needs that might emerge after core functionalities are established.

#### **Month 5-6: Integration & Advanced Personalization**

*   **Major Milestones:**
    *   **Milestone 3.1: Integration with Third-Party Calendar Apps**
        *   **Priority:** High
        *   **Description:** Seamless integration with popular calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook) to automatically detect upcoming trips and offer delegation options.
        *   **Timeline:** End of Month 5
        *   **Success Metrics:**
            *   25% of users connect their calendar accounts.
            *   50% of delegated trips initiated via calendar integration.
            *   User satisfaction with calendar integration ease-of-use > 4.3/5.0.
    *   **Milestone 3.2: Personalized Travel Pattern Analysis & Suggestions**
        *   **Priority:** Medium
        *   **Description:** The system analyzes user travel patterns to proactively suggest optimized delegation rules or re-routing preferences.
        *   **Timeline:** End of Month 6
        *   **Success Metrics:**
            *   10% of users accept at least one personalized suggestion.
            *   Increase in average daily active users by 5% attributed to personalized insights.
            *   User feedback on the helpfulness of suggestions > 70% positive.

*   **Reasoning for Prioritization:**
    *   **Calendar Integration (High):** This drastically improves the onboarding experience and reduces friction for users to initiate delegation, making the product more sticky and integrated into daily workflows.
    *   **Personalized Travel Pattern Analysis (Medium):** This adds a layer of proactive intelligence and optimization, enhancing long-term user value. It's prioritized after core integrations to ensure the foundation is solid before offering more advanced, data-driven features.
