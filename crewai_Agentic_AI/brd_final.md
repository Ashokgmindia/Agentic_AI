The provided input "Gather requirements for a contact management system" is a very high-level directive and lacks the specific details required to populate a comprehensive Business Requirements Document (BRD). To fulfill the request effectively, I need to make several assumptions and identify critical open questions. I will structure the BRD as requested, but it will be largely based on industry standards for contact management systems and will highlight areas requiring immediate stakeholder input.

**Assumptions made to populate the BRD:**

*   **Core Functionality:** The system is intended for managing contact information (individuals and organizations), tracking interactions, and facilitating communication.
*   **Target Users:** Sales, Marketing, Customer Support, and Account Management teams are primary users.
*   **Integration Needs:** Basic integration with email clients (e.g., Outlook, Gmail) and calendaring is likely required.
*   **Data Security:** Compliance with general data privacy principles (like GDPR, though specific requirements are unknown) is expected.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to grow with the organization's contact volume.
*   **User Experience:** An intuitive and user-friendly interface is a baseline expectation.
*   **Reporting:** Basic reporting capabilities on contact activity and data are necessary.

**Open Questions:**

*   What specific business problems will this contact management system solve?
*   What are the key strategic objectives this system will support?
*   Who are the primary stakeholders providing input? What are their specific roles and priorities?
*   What is the current system (if any) being used, and what are its shortcomings?
*   What is the expected user base size and growth projection?
*   Are there any specific industry regulations beyond general data privacy that must be adhered to (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare, FINRA for finance)?
*   What level of integration is needed with other existing systems (e.g., CRM, ERP, marketing automation)?
*   What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) for success?
*   What is the budget and timeline for this project?
*   What are the specific requirements for data import/export?
*   What are the needs for search and filtering capabilities?
*   What are the requirements for user roles and permissions?
*   What is the desired level of customization?
*   What are the expectations for mobile access or offline capabilities?
*   Are there any specific data points that *must* be captured for each contact/organization?

Given these assumptions and open questions, I will construct a foundational BRD. The "Consolidated Stakeholder Requirements" section will be minimal and will serve as a placeholder for detailed input.

I now can give a great answer.

## 6. Compliance & Governance Considerations

*   **Applicable regulations**:
    *   **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: If handling data of EU citizens, principles of lawful processing, data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure), data protection by design/default, and security measures must be addressed.
    *   **CCPA/CPRA (California Consumer Privacy Act / California Privacy Rights Act)**: Similar to GDPR, focusing on consumer rights regarding personal information.
    *   **[Other industry-specific regulations, e.g., HIPAA, FINRA]**: *To be identified based on the organization's industry and data scope.*
*   **Data privacy, security, and audit implications**:
    *   **Data Classification**: Define sensitivity levels for contact data.
    *   **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users only access data relevant to their roles.
    *   **Audit Trails**: Maintain logs of significant user actions (create, update, delete, data access) for accountability and compliance.
    *   **Data Retention Policies**: Define how long contact data should be retained and establish processes for secure deletion.
    *   **Security Measures**: Implement measures such as encryption (at rest and in transit), secure authentication, and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
*   **Required controls or documentation**:
    *   Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) if third-party processors are involved.
    *   Privacy Policy updates.
    *   Security assessment reports.
    *   User access review procedures.
